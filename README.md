# Network Layer Communication Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains resources and documentation for analyzing network layer communication, as part of an activity for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certification Program. The focus of this analysis is on understanding the behavior of DNS and ICMP traffic under various network conditions and configurations.

## Activity Details

**Activity Name:** Analyze Network Layer Communication

This activity involves capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify issues and anomalies in DNS and ICMP protocols. The analysis provides insights into common network issues such as unreachable ports and misconfigured servers or firewalls.

## Repository Structure

- `/logs` - Directory containing sample network traffic logs for analysis.
- `/scripts` - Scripts used for capturing and analyzing network data.
- `/docs` - Additional documentation and findings from the network analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with analyzing the network traffic:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `/scripts` directory.
3. Run the provided scripts to start capturing your network traffic.
4. Analyze the output as per the guidelines provided in the `/docs` directory.

## Tools Used

- `tcpdump`: For capturing the network traffic logs.
- Analysis tools and scripts provided in the `/scripts` directory.
